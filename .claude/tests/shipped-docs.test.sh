# Every docs/ path the harness tells an agent to read is either delivered by the
# refresh or declared to be one the project writes (HARNESS-040, AC-5).
#
# Issue #104, Symptom A. `/audit-mutations` and the mutation-tester agent name
# docs/wiki/audits/TEMPLATE.md; the refresh left all of docs/** alone; a project
# vendored before the template existed never received it, and nothing said so.
# The refresh now ADDS what .claude/harness/docs-shipped.conf lists as `ship`.
# This suite is what stops the NEXT template from repeating the defect: a
# command, agent or skill that names a docs/ path the conf neither ships nor
# declares `written` is reported here, by file and by path.
#
# The sites are prose, so nothing executes them - the shape `tdd-cycle` calls
# "code no machine you have can execute: grep for the shape". A static check is
# the correct instrument, not a substitute for a test that could have been
# written instead. Modelled on policy.test.sh: `shipped_docs_problems <root>` is
# run over REPO_ROOT, where it must print nothing, and over a fixture built
# compliant by construction with one site regressed, where it must print exactly
# one line naming it. The second is what makes the first mean anything. DV-3 in
# the story is the same probe against a REAL line of the tree, owned by GATES.
#
# What a literal reference is (the story's Contract, C-6): every token matching
# the ERE `docs/[A-Za-z0-9_./-]*` with one trailing `.` stripped; a token ending
# in `/` is a PATTERN (`docs/wiki/audits/<scope>-<date>.md`, `docs/wiki/design/**`,
# `docs/backlog/stories/*.md` and `docs/wiki/` all stop at the slash) and is
# skipped. A reference is counted once per (file, path) pair: a file naming the
# same path twice is one reference and, if uncovered, one problem line.
#
# Written limit, asserted below as AC-5(d): a path under a `written` DIRECTORY
# entry is covered whatever its basename, so a template dropped under
# docs/backlog/epics/ or docs/backlog/stories/ is invisible to this rule.
#
# Portable awk only (CI runs mawk): no gensub, no --re-interval, no \<.

# docs/ is the project's own, never the harness's: docs-shipped.conf declares
# docs/backlog/stories/ written, and a refresh ships no story. A suite that
# reads under the real checkout's docs/ therefore reads, in a consumer, a file
# that is absent or is somebody else's (HARNESS-106 Context: boundaries read
# four upstream story files and failed four assertions in a consumer). A
# fixture a suite needs lives under .claude/tests/fixtures/, which ships.
#
# suite_docs_files <root>   The scanned files, relative to <root>, in LC_ALL=C
# name order: every <root>/.claude/tests/*.sh, top level only (the suites,
# _lib.sh, _spawns.sh).
#
# suite_docs_reads <root>   One line `<file>:<line number>` per line of a
# scanned file that is not a whole-line comment (first non-blank character `#`)
# and matches SDR_RE: one of the two names _lib.sh gives the real checkout,
# REPO_ROOT or TESTS_DIR/../.., then any of `}` and `"` (so the braced and the
# quoted-root spellings count), then /docs as a whole path component (so
# docs-shipped.conf and a docsy/ never match). Silent when nothing reads there.
# No exception for a `ship` entry either: docs/wiki/audits/TEMPLATE.md is added
# only where the project has none, so in a consumer it is the consumer's.
#
# Written limit: the rule reads text, not data flow. A path built in a variable
# first (d="$REPO_ROOT", then "$d/docs/..."), a cd "$REPO_ROOT" followed by a
# relative docs/..., and git -C "$REPO_ROOT" show HEAD:docs/... are not seen.
#
# This suite is one of the files it scans, and its fixtures below hold
# offending lines as data. So the two root names are spelled in pieces
# wherever /docs follows them, here and in the fixtures; no file is exempted
# by name. The real-tree assertion is the check that this was done.
